# Instruction Set Architecture

ISA defines the following -

1. the state of the system - registers, program counters and memory
2. The instructions the CPU can execute
3. the impact of those instructions

ISA tells -

1. What instructions are available. How are they encoded because the computer only understands binary.
2. How many registers are available and what are their sizes?
3. Memory addressing mode.
