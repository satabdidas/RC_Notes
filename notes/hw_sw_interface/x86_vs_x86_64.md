# x86 vs x86_64 instructions

Now you can move 8 bytes of data. Hence the instructions look like -

movq
addq

'q' stands for quad.

The existing x86 instruction are supported too.

## No stack operations
There's one more difference

```
void swap(int* xptr, int* yptr) {
     int t0 = *xptr;
     int t1 = *yptr;

     *xptr = t1;
     *xptr = t0;
}
```

x86 instructions

x86_64 instruction
```
movl %(rdi) %eax
movl %(rsi) %edx

movl %edx %(rdi)
movl %eax %(rsi)
```

No stack operations required. Hence faster than x86.
